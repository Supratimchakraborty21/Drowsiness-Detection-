# Drowsiness-Detection-
Core Skills/Tools used:
I’ve skillfully applied some of the Machine Learning techniques: -Image/Video Preprocessing (NumPy):
Demonstrated proficiency in facial image and video manipulation. Efficiently implemented techniques like face
detection, eye tracking, grayscale conversion, and normalization using NumPy’s powerful array capabilities.
-Deep Learning Model Development (PyTorch): Architected and trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs)
-Model Optimization (PyTorch): Enhanced model performance by employing techniques like quantization,
pruning, or knowledge distillation in PyTorch to create lightweight models suitable for embedded systems.
-Dataset Preparation and Augmentation (NumPy, PyTorch): Curated and preprocessed drowsy driving
datasets, applying data augmentation (random cropping, flipping, noise injection) with NumPy and PyTorch
to increase robustness and prevent overfitting.
Successfully implemented a Drowsiness Detection system using OpenCV, Pytorch
